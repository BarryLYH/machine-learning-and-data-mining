Machine learning work and ICO data mining project codes

1. ICO_project file contains data mining and data merging codes.

2. LSTM_code file is the project to do prediction based on long-short-term-memory deep learning method. The code is wirtten by Tensorflow.

3. ml_practise is random forest and catboosting method to do prediction. The other one is CNN model by Pytorch to do digital recongnier.
